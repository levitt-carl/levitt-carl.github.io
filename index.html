<h2>A note on the distinct lack of design currently on display.</h2>
<p>Good design is tremendously important. Design can turn the raw ingredients of content into a delicious feast. Nevertheless, a well-designed apparition nourishes not at all. To that end I will focus on design, but not in place of content. I hope that you find my porridge of scribblings well enough that you will return one day to find my table set delicately for your enjoyment.</p>

<h2>The grist</h2>
<p>6/9/17</p>
<p>Yesterday was one of the more eventful days in an an already eventful year. My attention was primarily focused on the Comey testimony. Like most people these days I have been following Comey's actions as they shuffle in and out of the limelight. As for the testimony itself, we learned very little substance that we did not already know. Comey and his support network have disseminated much of his side of the story through document and anecdote. What we hear today was how worried Comey actually was about the breach of norms. Furthermore he challenged the senate and by extension the American people to measure his credibility against Trump's.</p>
<p>Given Comey's reputation among many bitter Democrats and some overly zealous Trump supporters this is a bold move. Before he was fired Comey was not a very popular man. He was blamed for costing Clinton the election while simultaneously not finding her guilty and presenting a firing squad to dispense justice. And while the "deep state"<a href=#deepstate id="linkback1">*</a> has a high opinion of him because of his years of service (Particularly his actions in the Ashcroft boondogle cemented his reputation among those with long institutional memories.) that reputation has spread to the greater population as a whole. But aside from those in congress and the institutionalized state who respect him Comey found little love. His actions viz. Ms. Clinton essentially introduced to a wider population that would have no occasion to even know who was the director of the FBI. This wider population did not know of his integrity and years of service. Like with all bureaucrats, even bureaucrats that are also lawyers and cops, if people generally know who this bureaucrat is in the public discourse the then something has already gone wrong.</p>
<p>That Comey is willing to throw down on credibility with Trump, his former boss, who fired him and who has democratic legitimacy<a href=#active id="linkback2">*</a> speaks volumes not only on Comey's opinion of Trump but also Comey's perception of the general response to Trump. Much of this stems from presentation. Comey comes off as exceedingly credible when he is allowed to answer in hearings. He is well composed and professional about his governance in exactly the way that Trump is not. We saw this in the testimony on the loyalty dinner. Comey as the nation's top cop cannot contemplate giving <i>personal</i> loyalty. In his testimony he returned to the buffer of the justice department, the chain of command as it were. Comey is bolstering his reputation by focusing on norms. Norms are powerful especially when it comes to the Executive power.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we won't know any conclusions for some time yet as the investigation continues. Indeed this may fade from the public's eye as the Republican congress gauges public opinion<a href=#ass id="linkback3">*</a></p>

<p id="deepstate">*The deep state is a common shorthand for the permanent military and intelligence staffers. The deep state in America differs from the classic Deep State in for example Turkey in that the deep state in America is too diverse in both opinion and in function to meaningfully exert co-ordinated control. There is a collection of very important very knowledgeable people that occupy a number of positions in the government. They are not the type to plan a coup but rather the type to grumble and then argue about policies that the vast majority of people never need to think about.</p>

<p>Note: My definition of the deep state is not a universally accepted definition but I think it is still useful to think about the administrators of the state that are generally not political appointees and if they are, then they are so integrated into their role that politicians dare not upset the status quo with replacement.<a href=#linkback1>(back)</a></p>

<p id="active">*There are several things to say about democratic legitimacy and foreign active measures. The crux of the conundrum is that unless there is active election tampering on the mechanical level the stakes will always be too high. The second issue is assessing real democratic choice in light of active measures. There is no way determine who voted out of good conscience and who voted because of a foreign influence without a priori settling the election. Legitimacy becomes a polite fiction because the alternative is far worse.<a href=#linkback2>(back)</a></p>
